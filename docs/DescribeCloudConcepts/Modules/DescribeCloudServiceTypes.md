# Describe Cloud Service Types

## 1 - Describe Infrastructure as a Service

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a fundamental cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources, infrastructure, over the internet. 

In this model, users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking components from a cloud service provider rather than investing in and maintaining physical infrastructure. 

IaaS offers flexibility and scalability, allowing businesses to scale resources up or down based on demand. 

Users have control over operating systems, applications, and configurations, while the cloud provider manages the underlying hardware.

## 2 - Describe Platform as a Service

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides a comprehensive platform, including development tools, runtime environments, and services, to streamline the process of building, deploying, and managing applications. 

An example of PaaS is Vercel, which is a website for hosting other websites, it is not considered a SaaS because it is not a website previously assembled for the possibility of modification, but rather a place to upload your own SaaS.

In PaaS, developers can focus on coding and application functionality, while the cloud provider handles the underlying infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking. 

This model accelerates development, promotes collaboration, and reduces the complexity associated with traditional application deployment. 

PaaS is well-suited for organizations looking to enhance agility, improve time-to-market, and efficiently manage the entire application lifecycle without the burden of infrastructure management.

## 3 - Describe Software as a Service
Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model that delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. 

In the SaaS model, users access and use applications hosted by a third-party provider, eliminating the need for local installation and maintenance. 

This approach offers advantages such as accessibility from any device with an internet connection, automatic updates, and scalability.

SaaS is known for its cost-effectiveness, as organizations only pay for the services they use. It provides a user-friendly experience, facilitates collaboration, and allows businesses to focus on using software rather than managing infrastructure, making it a popular choice for various applications in the cloud.
